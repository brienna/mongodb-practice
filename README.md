# MongoDB project

In this assignment, you will develop an application using MongoDB. The goal of the assignment is to develop a basic search application that can be used to search tweets or comparable data of your choice.

## Part 1: Backend application

For backend processing you must use the MongoDB database management system. You shoul use the twitter dataset with 11,000 documents and choose data from some source that allows you to download a large quantity of data. There should be thousands of documents and several property/value pairs for each document. Each document must contain at least one property having at least as much text as a standard tweet (140 chars).
